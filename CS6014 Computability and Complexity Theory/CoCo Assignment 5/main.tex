\begin{questions}

    \question Which of the following statements are true, which are false? Give a short proof of your answers.
    
    \begin{parts}
        \part If $L$ and $L'$ are ${\sf P}$-complete, so is $L \cup L'$.
            \begin{solution}
                
            \end{solution}
        \part If ${\sf L} = {\sf P}$, then every nontrivial language in ${\sf L}$ is ${\sf P}$-complete.
            \begin{solution}
                
            \end{solution}
        \part $\operatorname{\mathsf{PolyL}} \stackrel{\triangle}{=} \bigcup_{i \in {\mathbb N}} {\sf DSpace}(\log^i n)$ has complete problems (under log space many-one reductions).
            \begin{solution}
                
            \end{solution}
    \end{parts}

    \question Show that the following problem  is hard for {\sf NL} under log-space many-one reductions. Input: A set $A$ with an associative binary operation `$*$', a subset $S\subseteq A$, and an element $w\in A$.\\
    Output: YES if there is a set of elements $a_1, \ldots, a_k\in S$ such that $a_1*a_2*\ldots * a_k= w$.\\
    Assume that $A$ is closed under $*$. Is the problem complete for $\NL$? Prove your answer.

    \begin{solution}
        
    \end{solution}

    \question Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Consider two persons playing the
    following game: The first player occupies some given vertex $v_0$.
    Then the second player chooses a non-occupied neighbor $v_1$ of
    $v_0$ (i.e.\ $(v_0, v_1)\in E$) and occupies it. Then the first
    player chooses some non-occupied neighbor $v_2$ of $v_1$ and
    occupies it (in addition to $v_0$). The game is continued in this
    way until one play is not able to extend the path $v_0, v_1, \ldots$
    by a non-occupied neighbor of the current vertex. The player who
    played the last move wins the game.
    
    ${\sf GEO}$ is the following problem: Given a directed graph $G$ and a
    vertex $v_0$ of $G$ decide whether the first player has a winning
    strategy for the game above.
    
    Prove that ${\sf GEO}$ is ${\sf PSPACE}$-complete.

    \begin{solution}
        
    \end{solution}

    \question Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ are said to be strongly connected if there is a directed  path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ as well as there is a directed path from $v$ to $u$ in $G$. Let \[ {\sf StrConn} = \{\langle G, s,t \rangle\ |\ s \text{ and } t \text{ are}  \ \text{ strongly connected in }G\}.\] Show that ${\sf StrConn}$ is $\NL$-complete (under logarithmic space many-one reductions.)
  
    \begin{solution}
        
    \end{solution}

    \question A language $A$ is called \emph{downward self-reducible}, if there is a polynomial time oracle deterministic Turing machine $M$ that on input $x$, only queries oracle strings with length $< |x|$ such that $A = L(M^A)$.
    \begin{parts}
	\part Show that {\sf SAT} is downward self reducible.
	\part Show that if $A$ is downward self reducible, then $A \in {\sf PSPACE}$.
    \end{parts}
