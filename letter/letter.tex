Respected Ma'am,
\\
%references such as what and how you got this information
\vspace{1em}
I am writing to bring to your attention an important matter 
regarding my current health condition and its impact on my 
ability to carry out long journeys to office in fully packed trains.

%narrate why you want to apply
\vspace{1em}
Regrettably, I have been facing spinal cord injuries that have gradually worsened over time. It has come to a point where traveling on jerky train rides exacerbates my condition and causes considerable discomfort and pain.
Additionally, standing for prolonged periods during such 
journeys is becoming increasingly challenging for me. Due to spinal cord related injuries I am falling far too often to the ground which are creating
dangerous situations to my health.

\vspace{1em}
Considering the nature of my condition and the limitations it imposes on my ability to commute, I humbly request your kind consideration in transferring me to the nearest branch in Barasat.
The proximity of this branch to my residence will significantly alleviate the strain of commuting long distances, thereby enabling me to perform my duties effectively while managing my health condition.

I am providing additional documentation or medical records that would help substantiate my condition and the necessity of this transfer.
% %conclusion


Thank you for considering my request. 
I genuinely appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to discussing this further with you.
