# Assignment of some data to a variable:
a = 20
# Now 20 as an integer value is assigned to variable called a
# Now if we print the value a we'll get 20

print(a)   # --> 20

# You can also store string float anything into a variable
# Storing string
a = 'Hello Guys'

# Storing floats
a_float = 6.88
print(type(a_float))  # --> <class 'float'>
