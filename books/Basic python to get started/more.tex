\section{Currently and in the future}
Hey guys I have a quick announcement to make. This version of the basic python book is the newest edition. In the next version I'll include for loops, concepts of simple data structures like arrays linked list etc.\\


\noindent I'm trying very hard to come up the full version for this book. New chapters like Functions, Object oriented programming is in the pipelines. I'm currently a CS undergraduate and developing useful libraries for python. So it's really hard for me to manage the book and update you regularly.\\


\noindent If you want to connect with me or if you have any suggestions regarding this book I'd love to connect with you. Send me a message via Twitter @theroyakash or connect with me on instagram @theroyakash or LinkedIn at theroyakash.\\


\noindent My github profile is @theroyakash and I'm available on discord for direct messaging at @theroyakash\#5635.
